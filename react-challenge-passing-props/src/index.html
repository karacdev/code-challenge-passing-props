<p>In the JS section of this Codepen is a React class component called App that contains some information about an upcoming party in its state. For the following challenges, you will only need to edit code in the JS section, not the HTML or CSS.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Challenge 1</strong>: Between the div tags at lines 18 and 20 of the JS section, render a component named <strong>&lt;Party&gt;</strong> and pass the partyType, entertainment, and venue properties from the state.</li>
  <li><strong>Challenge 2</strong>: Create/define a new React component named Party. In it, have it return a div that contains h3 tags surrounding the words Party Time!, followed by two paragraph elements that use the passed-in props. The first paragraph element will say: This _____ party will be held at ______ with a maximum capacity of ____. The second paragraph element will say: Featured entertainment: ______! The blanks will be filled in using props. See the screenshot in the learning portal page for this code challenge.</li>
  <li><strong>Challenge 3</strong>: Add another property to the state in App, pass it as props to the Party component, and use it somewhere in the Party component. The property is up to you. Some examples: an array with a list of guest names, a cake flavor, the name of the birthday person, the address of the venue, etc!</li>    
</ul>
